1. just make sure all the folders that are present in this directory are uploaded on jupyter
2. please run the online version of jupyter and not the local one as the online version has updated packages
3. do not run the data collection code as we already have that data on that node
4. if at all you want to run the data collection code then just uncomment the got3 import in the import section and run the data collection tab
5. note that the data collection tab would take atleast 25 mins to collect tweets, and the results may slightly vary after that.
6. run the file with the extension .ipynb and not the python file for better visualization. Running the python file would mean all the packages has to be pre-installed on the local machine but without any version conflict, which is a bit difficult to set up on different environments.
7. We have included the json format of the entire database, so please open the json file in a browser to view the data
